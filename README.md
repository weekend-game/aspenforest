## AspenForest

**The game is written in the Weekend Game Language**

A knight walks through an aspen forest. He encounters various situations and must decide how to act in each one.

This repository contains the interpreter and the game code.

### How to run the program

Download the repository to your computer. First, you need to run the language interpreter. To do this, double-click the WeekendInterpreter.jar file or, if it doesn't start, double-click the WeekendInterpreter.bat file. If the latter doesn't start the application, download and install Java 11 or later and try the methods described above again.

After running the interpreter, open the AspenForest.wgl file and press F5 to run it.

### How to play

The output panel (the lower half of the application window) will describe the current situation and offer options for further action. Enter the numbers corresponding to your choice.

I must apologize for having to enter answers in a pop-up window that appears in an inconvenient location. But this implementation of the INPUT command was the simplest.

### Results

It's funny! Using this language to write even a very simple program, you begin to appreciate what OOP and even structured programming give programmers. I found it interesting to briefly step back in time. It was as if I wasn't writing a program, but participating in a time machine test.
