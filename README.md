## AspenForest

**The game is written in the Weekend Game Language**

This repository contains a precompiled interpreter and the game code. First, you need **to run the interpreter**. You can do this by double-clicking on the WeekendInterpreter.jar file or, if it does not start, by double-clicking on the WeekendInterpreter.bat file. If the latter does not start the application, download and install Java 11 or later and try the methods described above again.

After starting the interpreter, open the AspenForest.wgl file and press F5 to run it.

The output panel (the lower half of the application window) will describe the following situation and offer options for further action. Specify the number corresponding to your choice.

Sorry, you will have to enter the answers in a dialogue window, and it will appear in an inconvenient place. But this implementation of the INPUT command was the simplest.
